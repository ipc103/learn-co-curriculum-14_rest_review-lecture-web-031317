## REST Review

1. Stands for Representational State Transfer
2. Relates to the different CRUD actions
3. For each 'resource', seven different actions
4. HTTP Verbs combined with paths (or URLS) map to Controller Actions
  + These controller actions perform some CRUD and then display some result to the user
5. Just a concept, a design pattern for mapping Web Requests to CRUD actions
